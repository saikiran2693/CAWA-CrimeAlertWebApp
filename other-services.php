                        In case of all fire, police or medical emergencies, call 911 to contact help. Almost all areas of Canada are covered by this emergency help line; however there may be some remote rural areas where there are local numbers to call. All urban and suburban areas are covered by the 911 code system.

                        All phone calls to 9-1-1 are free, including calls made by pay phone or cell phone.  Please note that calls must be of an urgent nature, such as: if you have witnessed a crime that has just occurred or is still in progress; if you see an uncontrolled fire; if medical help is immediately required; if someone is trapped, drowning or taken a serious fall (think life and limb); if something catastrophic has occurred that has the potential to become much worse or could endanger human life (e.g.: landslide on a road, tree down over power lines, flooding) . Do not call 9-1-1 to obtain information, to make a complaint, to report a power outage, or for highway or weather information.The police will respond and you will be fined for abusing emergency services.

                        When you reach the 9-1-1 centre, you will likely be asked to state the nature of your emergency: fire, police, or ambulance. You will then be asked to give the full details of your emergency. DO NOT HANG UP ON 9-1-1 until the 9-1-1 operator tells you to; only the 9-1-1 operator knows when enough information has been gathered about your emergency and its location. You should not hang up even if you feel you dialed 9-1-1 in error; in many jurisdictions, 9-1-1 operators are required to take action on all 9-1-1 calls, even if the caller hung up the phone without speaking.
